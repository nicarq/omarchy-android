# Installer options

The installer is conservative by default: it creates a new container, shares
no host files, uses automatic display detection, and refuses unsupported
architectures.

## Graphics

- `--gpu auto` selects KGSL when a compatible render device and Mesa stack are
  available, otherwise it selects the software fallback.
- `--gpu kgsl` requires direct KGSL acceleration and fails instead of silently
  falling back.
- `--gpu software` is the VirGL/pixman compatibility path. It uses the X11
  backend from the installed Termux Weston package, avoiding a bundled
  Weston 14 / current Weston ABI mismatch. Automatic refresh is 60 Hz here.

On supported Adreno devices, Chromium renders through ANGLE/Vulkan and the
pinned Turnip driver, with XWayland used only for local presentation. PRoot
cannot provide Chromium's normal Linux namespace/GPU sandbox around direct
KGSL access, so accelerated Chromium displays an unsupported-flag warning.
Android's Termux application sandbox remains in effect; see
[`privacy.md`](privacy.md).

GPU rendering does not imply hardware media decoding. Chromium video decode
and encode remain software paths in `v0.1.0`.

With the native Weston 16+ backend, automatic resolution follows the Android
window as it folds, unfolds, or rotates. Startup selects Termux:X11 scaling
to target a long edge of at most 1920 pixels on the starting screen; that
percentage stays constant during the session so the aspect ratio can change.
The resize listener updates Weston without restarting the desktop or its apps.
The bundled Weston 14 backend retains its startup resolution and long-edge cap.
Explicit modes use `WIDTHxHEIGHT` and follow orientation rather than panel shape.
Refresh can be automatic or
30-240 Hz. Scale affects logical UI size, not the physical output pixel count.

`--keyboard auto` maps French Android locales to `fr` and otherwise uses `us`.
Pass an XKB layout such as `--keyboard fr` when the physical keyboard differs
from the phone locale.

## Sharing

- `none`: the guest cannot see Termux home or phone storage.
- `termux`: exposes Termux home at `~/Host/Termux`.
- `storage`: exposes Android shared storage at `~/Host/Phone`.
- `both`: enables both explicit mounts.

Sharing is never enabled merely because Termux has storage permission.

## Android process restriction

Full Omarchy needs Android Developer options -> **Disable child process
restrictions** enabled. The installer checks the same persistent property used
by the proven runtime and stops early when the restriction is active. This is
a local Android setting; ADB and wireless debugging are not required.

`--allow-process-limit` explicitly accepts the reduced-capacity fallback. The
native process guard then protects the session from Android's phantom-process
reaper, but larger application sets may still be unable to run together.

## Verification and reproducibility

The installer downloads a release bundle and verifies its manifest and pinned
SHA-256 checksum before extraction. Custom graphics and shell components build
from the exact revisions in `manifest/components.lock`; the release also
records the complete Arch package name/version closure. Arch repositories are
rolling, so bit-for-bit reconstruction additionally depends on continued
availability of those recorded package versions. See
[`builder/README.md`](../builder/README.md) and
[`THIRD_PARTY.md`](../THIRD_PARTY.md).
